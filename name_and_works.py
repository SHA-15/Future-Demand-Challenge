Their repertoire consists of arrangements of classical works and original compositions commissioned by the 12. Boris Blacher was the first contemporary composer to w

The ensemble is also a pioneer in the field
of crossover and has performed arrangements of songs by the Beatles, gospel music, tangos, jazz, and film compositions, thus ensuring a diversity of programming that appeals to audiences beyond the classical music community.
